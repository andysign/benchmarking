Benchmarks are formatted as follows.

```
<engine> <contract> <instantiation time or invocation time> <list of comma separated times>
```

The invocation time is for to parsing/validating/compiling. The invocation time is for calling an already instantiated contract.

The list of times are in microseconds, and are in order of the tests executed. To see the list of tests, see the `test_vectors` directory or generate the yml fillers.
